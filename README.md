# Ideas

The submitted idea must be related to one of the WK products or improvements in the operation of the team / department or company. The idea should be based on your concept,  rather than functionality assigned to development tasks.

# Teams

You have freedom and flexibility in team building from the perspective of location and structure of Architecture and Development Department. You can invite team members from other company departments. The team can have up to 5 people. We can use any technology with one remark: we have to support deployed product in the future.

# Ideas presentations

At the beginning of the event, teams show a short (5 minute max) presentation and present goals and MVP to be achieved. All presentations are being shown online, throguh company communication channel.

# Work on projects

Everyting is in your hands! What matters? The final success or lessons learned from failure.

# Final presentations

There will be 10 to 15 minutes demo of a working solution.
During your presentation you should try convince others that your application is the best!

# Selecting winners

The best design will be selected during a secret voting process. Each team will have two votes. These votes have to be divided or given away for another project. This process will take maximum 10 minutes. A team of business representatives - VIP Jury - will be involved. They will be allocated half the votes in the number of submitted projects (rounded down). Upon completion of the voting, results will be published, along with information which team becomes a winner. If two or more of the projects will gain the same number of votes, two crucial votes will be given away by the head of the department or a person delegated by the head. All the participants of the winning team will receive an award.

# After party

After the end of a long and intensive day all interested people can participate together in celebration party. You can choose the place and formula - if you can handle it!
